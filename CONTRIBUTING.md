# Contributing to Bold üåà

### Hello! üëã
We are happy for your interest in contributing to Bold! But before you start it is important that you read the contribution guide.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention: All issues must be written in English!

## Reporting Bugs üêõ
1. Search for issues with the BUG tag to see if the issue has already been reported by another contributor.
1. Check if the bug has already been resolved - try to reproduce the bug using the last master or branch in the repository.
1. When reporting the bug, use our template and try to insert as much information about the problem. Describe the bug, the steps to reproduce the error, the expected behavior and the version of the system. Whenever possible, include images and supplementary information to help explain the context.
1. To facilitate the search, name the issue as follows: [Component] Error found and add the tag BUG. Use the names specified on the website http://bold.bridge.ufsc.br/

Example: [Select] Component doesn't render correctly in Safari

## Proposing new components ‚≠êÔ∏è
New components are welcome, but before creating an issue, you should check if the component already exists or if it is possible to adjust your need to use an existing component. Analyze the flowchart below before suggesting new components, so we avoid duplication and guarantee the consistency of the Design System.

If the right component does not exist:
1. Search for issues with the NEW COMPONENT tag to see if the issue has already been reported.
2. Create a new issue if it doesn't exist. Use our template to propose new components and include a link or image with the prototype of the proposed component, describe its context of use, what problem the new component solves and inform the possible status of the component. Add as much detail as possible, including your search and user needs. Try to use existing components to create the new pattern.

## Change an existing component 
Like the Design System, components are always in constant evolution and changes in components are expected.
But, before proposing any changes, certify whether the component will continue to meet existing requirements after your proposed change.
Analyze the flowchart above before proposing an amendment, so we avoid duplication and guarantee the consistency of the Design System.

If the right component does not exist:
1. Search for issues with the ENHANCEMENT tag to see if the issue has already been reported.
2. Create a new issue if it doesn't exist. Use our template to propose an amendment and include a link or image with the proposed changes, describe its context of use, what problem the new propose solves and inform the possible status of the component. Add as much detail as possible, including your search and user needs.
