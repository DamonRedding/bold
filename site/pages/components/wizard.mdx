# Wizard

Wizard is a visual representation of a user progress through a set of steps. They guide the user through a number of steps on order to complete a specified process. 

## Best practices

- Display the steps sequentially in order from left to right. 
- Allow the user to return to a previous step to review their data submission.
- When possible, use some indication of the status of the step, like when its complete/validated, or incomplete/invalidated.

## Wizard status

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width={160}>Complete</th>
    <td>Presented when users achieve the minimum required to continue to the next step.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Default</th>
    <td>Presented when the step was not validated yet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Error</th>
    <td>Informs the user that some information is incorrect.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Unabled</th>
    <td>When it's still not possible to access the next step of the wizard,  being necessary complete another item or information of the actual step.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
