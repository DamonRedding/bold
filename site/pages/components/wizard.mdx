# Wizard

Wizard is a visual representation of a user progress through a set of steps. They guide the user through a number of steps on order to complete a specified process. 

## Best practices

- Display the steps sequentially in order from left to right. 
- Allow the user to return to a previous step to review their data submission.
- When possible, use some indication of the status of the step, like when its complete/validated, or incomplete/invalidated.
