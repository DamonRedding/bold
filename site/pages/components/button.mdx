# Button

Buttons express what action will occur when the user clicks it. Buttons are used to initialize an action, and some examples include actions like Add, Save, and Delete.

## Best practices

- Do not use Buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use **Links** because it takes the user to a new page and is not associated with an action.
- Button labels tell users what will happen when they click the button. Use verbs that describe the action, such as **Add** or **Delete**. Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized) and no more than three words for button labels.
- For Sets of Buttons, use specific labels, such as **Save** or **Discard**, instead of using **OK** and **Cancel**. This is particularly helpful when the user is confirming an action.
