# Button

Buttons express what action will occur when the user clicks it. Buttons are used to initialize an action, and some examples include actions like Add, Save, and Delete.

## Best practices

- Do not use Buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use **Links** because it takes the user to a new page and is not associated with an action.
- Button labels tell users what will happen when they click the button. Use verbs that describe the action, such as **Add** or **Delete**. Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized) and no more than three words for button labels.
- For Sets of Buttons, use specific labels, such as **Save** or **Discard**, instead of using **OK** and **Cancel**. This is particularly helpful when the user is confirming an action.

## Button types

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width={160}>Primary</th>
    <td>For the principle call to action on the page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Secondary</th>
    <td>For secondary actions on each page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Button with icon</th>
    <td>
      When words are not enough, icons can be used in buttons to better communicate what the button does. Icons are
      always paired with text.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Disabled button</th>
    <td>Use when the user cannot proceed until an input is collected.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Set of buttons</th>
    <td>
      When an action required by the user has more than one option, always use a negative action button (secondary)
      paired with a positive action button (primary) in that order. Negative action buttons will be on the left.
      Positive action buttons should be on the right.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Ghost button</th>
    <td>When an action does not require primary dominance on the page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Small button</th>
    <td>Use when there is not enough vertical space for a regular sized button.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
