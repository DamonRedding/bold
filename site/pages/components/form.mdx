# Form

Forms are used for submitting data. Every input must be displayed with a label.

## Best practices

- When possible, data validation must occur before the user submits the form.
- Validation should occur as soon as the user takes the focus off that input.
- Use placeholders to assist entry of numeric fields. Placeholders are visible until the user starts typing.
- Use mask input that helps the user identify the input pattern.
- Required fields must be marked with a red asterisk after the label.
