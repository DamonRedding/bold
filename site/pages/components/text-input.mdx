# Text Input

Text input enable the user to interact with and input data.  They are normally found within a form but can also be part of a modal, search or card.

## Best practices

- Use placeholders to provide hints or examples of what to enter.
- Required fields must be signed with an red asterisk . If all fields are required there is no need to display an asterisk in all of them, but the obligatoriness must be indicated at the top of the page.
- The validation of the fields must occur in real time, making it easier for users to complete the task when filling the form.
