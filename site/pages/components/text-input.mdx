# Text Input

Text input enable the user to interact with and input data.  They are normally found within a form but can also be part of a modal, search or card.

## Best practices

- Use placeholders to provide hints or examples of what to enter.
- Required fields must be signed with an red asterisk . If all fields are required there is no need to display an asterisk in all of them, but the obligatoriness must be indicated at the top of the page.
- The validation of the fields must occur in real time, making it easier for users to complete the task when filling the form.

## Text Input types

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width={160}>Text-input</th>
    <td>Used when the user needs to insert only one line of text.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Text-area</th>
    <td>Used when the user needs to insert more than a sentence.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
