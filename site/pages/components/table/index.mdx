# Table

The component presents data distributed in lines and columns, displaying them in a logical order that allows easy reading, comparison and scan of the information.

## Best practices

- Columns were ordinating is possible, should present the sort icon in the right side of the label.
- The [Pagination](/components/pagination) component must be presented only when is page navigation (more than 10 items).

## Example

<Demo src='pages/components/table/TableDefault' />
