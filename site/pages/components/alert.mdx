# Alert

Alerts appear on the top of the screen and they display critical information about loss of data, functionality, error, etc.

## Best practices

- Should appear one at a time and a maximum of two lines should be used to display the messages.
- Use notifications to present information that needs to be viewed immediately and that requires user attention.
- Present clear, concise messages and give follow up actions to allow the user to become more informed or resolve the issue.
- Avoid displaying messages with technical error codes that do not help the user solve the problem.
- Present specific messages to each situation instead of using standard messages.
- Take blame when it's appropriate. Say "we're having trouble connecting" rather than "you're having connection issues".
