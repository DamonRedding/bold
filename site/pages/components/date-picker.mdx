# Date picker

Date components allow the user to make a specific selection through a visual calendar. By default, the calendar always displays the current month. If you already have a date entered, the calendar displays the month for that date.

## Best practices

- Use when the date selected is close to the actual date or for a period of less than 1 year.
- User should be able to enter value also through keyboard.
- Use placeholders to indicate the format of the data entry, for example: dd/mm/yyyy or mm/dd/yy, etc..
- The field should have only one input type, and should not be divided into fields for each information (day, month, year).
