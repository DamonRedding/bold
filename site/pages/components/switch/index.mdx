# Select

Select is a type of input that is used in forms, where a user is submitting data and chooses one option from a list. When text is inserted on the input field, filter the options. Consider showing suggestions when the select is active.

## Best practices

- Order the list by frequency of use, and if applicable, in ascending order.
- For situations where the user can select more than one option, use [Multi-select](/components/multi-select-search).
- Avoid using the select input for data that is known to the user, such as birth dates.
