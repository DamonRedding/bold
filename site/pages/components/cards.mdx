# Cards

A card is a UI design pattern that groups related information in a flexible-size container. A card is container for a few short, related pieces of information. Cards doesn't have a style pattern for texts and included information.

## Best practices

- Card layouts are less scannable than lists. A standard vertical list view is more scannable than cards because the positioning of the individual elements is fixed in size and more predictable for the eye. Thus, cards are not appropriate when users search for a specific item from a list or look for a particular piece of content. Instead, use [Tabs](/components/tabs) for better organization.
- Cards are an excellent choice for dashboard applications that display a variety of content types at the same time on the same page. In such situations, the card metaphor can help create more obvious differences between items, and each card can accommodate different elements.
