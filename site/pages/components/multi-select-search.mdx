# Multi-select Search

Use multi-select component to select more than 1 item from a list. The list usually contain 5 or more items. It allow to search and shows the items that have already been selected, or select all items at once.
If the number of pillboxes exceed the area of the component, use a [Tag](/components/tag) to indicate the number of hiding selected items (ex.: [+3]).

## Best practices

- Order the list by frequency of use, and if applicable, in ascending order.
- If the list show less than 5 items, consider displaying directly on the screen, using the [Checkbox](/components/checkbox) component.
- Whenever possible group the options and use short labels to describe the content (E.g.: In a food combo, the options can be grouped by: Vegetable, fruits, etc.)
- For situation where the user can select only one option, use [Select](/components/select) or [Radio Button](/components/radio-button).
