# Form

Forms are used for submitting data. Every input must be displayed with a label.

## Best practices

- When possible, data validation must occur before the user submits the form.
- Validation should occur as soon as the user takes the focus off that input.
- Use placeholders to assist entry of numeric fields. Placeholders are visible until the user starts typing.
- Use mask input that helps the user identify the input pattern.
- Required fields must be marked with a red asterisk after the label.

## Example

The following example don't use any lib to manage the form state. In practice, you may (bot not need to) use a third party library to manage form state, like [`react-use-form-state`](https://github.com/wsmd/react-use-form-state), [`react-final-form`](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form), [`formik`](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) etc.
