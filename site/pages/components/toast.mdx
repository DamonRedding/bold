# Toast

Use toast to show information that require minimal user interaction. Show these event-driven messages by overlaying the message at the bottom left of the screen, as if it was emerging from the navigation sidebar. Toasts can close automatically after 5 seconds, or they may require a manual close action.

## Best practices

- Try to keep the text of message concise: it can be up to two lines in length.
- Use dismiss icon to close flags.
- The flag must close after an action is taken, or after 5 seconds. If the flag receives hover status, it should be keeped open.
- Use a maximum of two links that allow users to respond to the flag's content.
- Informative icons can be used to make the message clear.
