## Our development process

We perform an extensive reference search to develop our components and inspired ourself by several design systems, mainly the <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/">Carbon Design System</a> and <a href="https://atlassian.design/">Atlassian Design</a>, also on the usability recommendations of the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com"> NN Group</a>.
During the development stages we also held discussions with developers and business analysts of various products of our laboratory, to cover as many use cases as possible.
